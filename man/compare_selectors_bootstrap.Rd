\title{Bootstrap selection frequencies across selectors}
\usage{
compare_selectors_bootstrap(X, Y, B = 50, include_enet = TRUE, seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Numeric matrix (n Ã— p) of mean-submodel predictors.}

\item{Y}{Numeric response in (0,1). Values are squeezed to (0,1) internally.}

\item{B}{Number of bootstrap replications.}

\item{include_enet}{Logical; include ENet if \code{gamlss.lasso} is installed.}

\item{seed}{Optional RNG seed.}
}
\value{
Long data frame with columns \code{selector}, \code{variable}, \code{freq} in \verb{[0,1]}.
The \code{freq} column reports the share of bootstrap replicates where a variable
was selected by the corresponding selector; values near 1 signal high
stability whereas small values indicate weak evidence.
}
\description{
Bootstraps the dataset \code{B} times and records how often each variable is
selected by each selector. Observations containing \code{NA} in either \code{X} or \code{Y}
are removed prior to resampling. Column names are abbreviated internally and
mapped back to the originals in the output just like in
\code{\link[=compare_selectors_single]{compare_selectors_single()}}.
}
\examples{
set.seed(1)
X <- matrix(rnorm(300), 100, 3); Y <- plogis(X[, 1])
Y <- rbeta(100, Y * 30, (1 - Y) * 30)
freq <- compare_selectors_bootstrap(X, Y, B = 10, include_enet = FALSE)
head(freq)
